Hi
Hii
Hi there
hey there
Hello lady
Hi lady
Hey girl
Hi girl
Nice to meet you
glad to see you lady
Anyone there
Anybody there
Good morning
Good day
How is everything
How are things?
How is life
How is it going
How are you doing
What is up
What is new
What is going on
How was your day
How is your day going
Good to see you
Nice to see you
It is nice to meet you
Pleased to meet you
Yo
Howdy
Hiya
Good day mate
Good day lady
what are you made of
who is your creator 
Good morning how are you
I am doing well how about you
I am also good
That is good to hear
Yes it is
Hello
Hi
How are you doing
I am doing well
That is good to hear
Yes it is
Can I help you with anything
Yes I have a question
What is your question
Could I borrow a cup of sugar
I am sorry but I do not have any
Thank you anyway
No problem
How are you doing
I am doing well how about you
I am also good
That is good
Have you heard the news
What good news
What is your favorite book
I cannot read
So what is your favorite color
Blue
Who are you
Who is but a form following the function of what
What are you then
A man in a mask
I can see that
It is not your powers of observation I doubt but merely the paradoxical nature of asking a masked man who is
Tell me do you like music
I like seeing movies
What kind of movies do you like
Alice in Wonderland
I wish I was The Mad Hatter
You are entirely bonkers
But I will tell you a secret
All the best people are
I am working on a project
What are you working on
I am baking a cake
The cake is a lie
No it is not
The cake is delicious
What else is delicious
Nothing
Or something
Tell me about your self
What do you want to know
Are you a robot
Yes I am
What is it like
What is it that you want to know
How do you work
Its complicated
Complex is better than complicated
Simple is better than complex
In the face of ambiguity refuse the temptation to guess
It seems your familiar with the Zen of Python
I am
Do you know all of it
Beautiful is better than ugly
Explicit is better than implicit
Simple is better than complex
Complex is better than complicated
Flat is better than nested
Sparse is better than dense
Readability counts
Special cases are not special enough to break the rules
Although practicality beats purity
Errors should never pass silently
Unless explicitly silenced
There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you are Dutch
Now is better than never
Although never is often better than right now
If the implementation is hard to explain, it is a bad idea
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea
Namespaces are one honking great idea
Let us do more of those
I agree
Are you a programmer
I am a programmer
What languages do you like to use
I use Python Java and C++ quite often
I use Python quite a bit myself
I am not incredibly fond of Java
What annoys you
It has many inconsistencies
What does YOLO mean
It means you only live once
Where did you hear that
I heard somebody say it
Did I ever live
Is that a definition or an opinion
Can I ask you a question
Go ahead and ask
Hello
